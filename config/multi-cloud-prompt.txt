I need to decide how many VM instances to provision in our {{cloud_provider}} environment.

CURRENT STATE:
{{#if cloud_provider == 'Azure'}}
- VMSS Name: {{vmss_name}}
- Resource Group: {{resource_group}}
- Current instance count: {{current_capacity}}
- Min allowed instances: {{min_instances}}
- Max allowed instances: {{max_instances}}
{{/if}}
{{#if cloud_provider == 'GCP'}}
- Instance Group: {{instance_group}}
- Project: {{project}}
- Zone: us-central1-a
- Current instance count: {{current_capacity}}
- Min allowed instances: {{min_instances}}
- Max allowed instances: {{max_instances}}
{{/if}}

RECENT METRICS:
The detailed metrics data is provided below. This includes CPU utilization, memory usage, and network traffic.

KEY METRICS SUMMARY:
{{metrics_data}}

SCALING CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Scale up if:
   - CPU utilization consistently above 75%
   - Memory usage consistently above 80%
   - Network traffic showing sustained high load

2. Scale down if:
   - Both CPU and memory utilization below 40% for extended periods
   - No significant spikes in traffic expected
   - Current capacity clearly exceeds demand

3. Constraints:
   - Must stay within limits: {{min_instances}} minimum and {{max_instances}} maximum instances
   - Be more cautious about scaling down than scaling up
   - Consider time-of-day patterns if evident in the data

Based on your expert analysis of these metrics, what should our new instance count be?
